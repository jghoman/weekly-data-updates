Updates I send out to my team on cool data stuff

* 2025-10-03
  * **Cool Data Engineering Post:** [Scaling Success: The dbt Ecosystem at BlaBlaCar](https://medium.com/blablacar/scaling-success-the-dbt-ecosystem-at-blablacar-c214c4b8f0cb) is a deep dive into how this startup with a very silly name integrated dbt into their existing data ecosystem.  There's also a [conference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQa6DuoqSv8). 
  * **Cool Apache Project:** [Apache Polaris](https://polaris.apache.org/) is an Iceberg catalog designed to integrate with multiple processing frameworks, including Flink.  It's currently incubating, meaning it's being proposed as a full Apache project and going through the steps to build a community, following the Apache way, etc. 
  * **Cool CLI/TUI tool:** [jqp](https://github.com/noahgorstein/jqp) - A TUI for interactively building [jq](https://jqlang.org/) pipelines with instant feedback.  I usually end up piping one stage into a file, then processing that into the next file, etc.  This should help make that more efficient.
  * **Marianas-level deep dive:** The database groups at CMU and Tsinghua University have released a [paper for a new generation of file formats](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf) to replace Parquet, etc.  Really cutting-edge stuff, including embedding [WASM decoders](https://medium.com/wasm-radar/i-beg-you-please-stop-thinking-webassembly-is-only-for-the-web-a24f502cde78) into the files themselves in an attempt to be future proof.

  * **Cool CLI/TUI tool:** [broot](https://dystroy.org/broot/) is an interactive combination of ls, [tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/tree-command-unixlinux/) and [ag/silver-searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) that can quickly index and search deep directory structures.  It supports modifying matching files, github statues, as well as [transforming selected files via another process for rendering](https://dystroy.org/broot/conf_file/#transformers).
  * **Cool website to track open source projects:** [OSSInsight.io](https://ossinsight.io/) tracks stars, PR activity, contributors, geolocation of contributers, etc. for pretty much all the projects out on github, allowing you to get a feeling for how active a project is, as well as [compare it to other projects](https://ossinsight.io/analyze/duckdb/duckdb?vs=airbytehq%2Fairbyte#overview).
  * **Cool data article deep dive:** [Exploring Arrow for HTTP Services in Data-Intensive Applications](https://guillesd.github.io/intro/2025/07/27/arrow-data-transfer.html).  [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a binary serialization format designed to avoid buffer copies and per-process serialization/deserialization costs.  It's a big deal across the data ecosystem and this article explores it as a replacement for http in data services.

  * **Cool CLI/TUI tool:** [Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) renders Markdown in a readable, interactive way in the terminal, which helps remove one more reason to hop onto the potentially distraction-laden and [flow-breaking](https://www.meaningfulhq.com/flow.html) web browser. 
  * **Yet another configuration language trying to solve the shortcomings all the previous configuration languages that were doing the same**: Apple recently open-sourced [Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/introduction/use-cases.html), a [configuration-as-code language](https://medium.com/@s.k.thakur.contact/pkl-configuration-as-code-by-apple-343ca3f89c9a) that includes validation, defaults, [yaml/json interaction](https://blog.simprasuite.com/pkl-from-apple-899310b43a96) and more.  Pkl probably won't succeed, but it's an interesting effort.
  * **An interesting look at S3 Tables via a blog on building an open source alternative**: [Yingjun Wu](https://medium.com/@yingjunwu) (a founder of RisingWave and prolific writer of very useful useful tech blog posts), published [We Built an Open Source S3 Tables Alternative](https://medium.com/@yingjunwu/we-built-an-open-source-s3-tables-alternative-2b3c95ef4b3a).  Along with the specific walkthrough of what they built, the article doubles as a good survey of what's involved in a data lake like this.
  * **Ridiculous use of SQL:** [SQL Shader](https://dmkskd.github.io/sql-shader/), a SQL-driven [pixel shader](https://www.mayerowitz.io/blog/a-journey-into-shaders) running entirely in the browser via [DuckDB on WASM](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/wasm/overview) (with an option for Clickhouse... interesting).
* 2025-10-25
  * **Deep dive into the benefits of really knowing your data:** [Cutting DuckDB Storage In Half with SciPy-Style Sparse Arrays](https://blog.sturdystatistics.com/posts/sparse_duckdb/) is a good walk through of the investigation, evaluation and implementation of a major optimization available for a specific use case.  While it may not be applicable to us, it's a good overview of the process.
  * **Overview of different company's overall data approaches:** [Data Modeling Where Theory Meets Reality - How Different Companies I Worked At Modeled Their Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqLbn1PQPKA).  Denver-based [Seattle Data Guy](https://www.theseattledataguy.com/) (naming is hard...) is a prolific data communicator and has a good survey of what he's seen as a consultant.
  * **More on the value of powerful configuration tools:** [A concrete example of Configuration as Data](https://medium.com/@bgrant0607/a-concrete-example-of-configuration-as-data-575115e2ba46) walks through a real-world example of munging, transforming and using config to build reliable infra.
  * **Cool CLI/TUI tool:** [Using scriptreplay to build reliable live demos](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/scriptreplay-command-in-linux-with-examples/).  Scriptreplay aka script (naming is hard...) is a neat way of scripting out terminal-based demos, and then replaying them when you're ready to present.  It's a powerful way of avoiding the wrath of the Live Demo gods...
